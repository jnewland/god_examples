Some silly examples of some of the things you can do with God.

h3. Rails Examples

To run the rails examples, you must first create the db (mysql) and migrate:

<pre>
  <code>
    cd rails
    cat config/database.yml #so you know what you're creating
    rake db:create:all
    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
  </code>
</pre>
